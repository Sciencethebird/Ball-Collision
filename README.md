- Real 2D collision motion
- Ball bounces off the edges of the window
- Color of the balls is random.
- You can choose initial velocity, start point, and size of a ball by mouse.
- Every time you click, a new Polygon Object instance is created and registered to the simple physics engine I wrote. Therefore, as long as your computer can handle, You can add as many balls as you want.
- Red arrow indicates velocity of a ball.

- How to include external libraries
- Understaning the basics of OpenGL

# Why
- I'm kinda interested in game/graphics programming.
