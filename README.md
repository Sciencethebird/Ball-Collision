![Alt text](https://github.com/Sciencethebird/Collision/blob/master/collision_demo_1.PNG)
- Real 2D collision motion(mass difference ignored)
- Ball bounces off the edges of the window
- Ball color is randomly initialized.
- You can choose the initial velocity, starting point, and size of a ball by mouse.
- A new Polygon Object is created right after a mouse click. The created ball object is then registered to the simple physics engine I wrote, which scans through all the balls for possible collision. As long as your computer can handle, You can add as many balls as you want.
- The length of a red arrow indicates the velocity of a ball.

# What I Learned 
- Utilize the concept of OOP to make something a bit more complex
- How to include external libraries
- Understanding the basics of OpenGL
- 2D collision (physics)

****
# Future Improvement
- Remove some bad coding practice
****
# Why
- I'm kinda interested in game/graphics programming. 
- Utilize OOP concept I learned
