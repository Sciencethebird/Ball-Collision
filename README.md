- Color of the balls is random
- You can choose initial velocity, start point, and size of a ball by mouse
- Every time you click, a new Polygon Object instance is created and registered to the simple physics engine I wrote, therefore as long as your computer can handle, You can add as many balls as you want

# Why
- I'm kinda interested in game/graphics programming.
